Introduction:
Welcome to our HR Attrition Analysis Project This project aims to meticulously examine employee attrition patterns within the organization, providing valuable insights into the underlying factors contributing to turnover. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, we intend to uncover actionable strategies to enhance employee retention and organizational stability. Join us in exploring the data-driven journey towards a more resilient and engaged workforce.

Dataset
Project Name: Employee Retention

Dataset Name: HR_1 and HR_2

Dataset Type: Excel Data

Dataset Size: 50,000 records each


Problem Statement:
The key areas of analysis include:

1. Average Attrition rate for all Departments.
2. Average Hourly rate of Male Research Scientist.
3. Attrition rate Vs Monthly income stats.
4. Average working years for each Department.
5. Job Role Vs Work life balance.
6. Attrition rate Vs Year since last promotion relation.

   
Skills/Concepts Demonstrated:

->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

->Power BI (Bookmarking, DAX, Quick Measures, Modelling, Filters, Tooltips.)

->Statistical analysis to derive insights.

->MySQL (Joins, Group by, Having, Window Functions, View, Aggregate Functions.)


Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. Organization will be better equipped to make data-driven decisions to enhance employee retention efforts.
2. The insights gained from the analysis will allow for more targeted and effective interventions ultimately fostering a more satisfied and engaged workforce.
3. Job satisfaction plays a significant role in attrition.
4. Salary level is correlated with attrition rates.
5. Employee performance ratings are linked to attrition.
