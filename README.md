Introduction
Welcome to our HR Attrition Analysis Project This project aims to meticulously examine employee attrition patterns within the organization, providing valuable insights into the underlying factors contributing to turnover. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, we intend to uncover actionable strategies to enhance employee retention and organizational stability. Join us in exploring the data-driven journey towards a more resilient and engaged workforce.
